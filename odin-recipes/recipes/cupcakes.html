        <p>You can use any chocolate cupcake or muffin recipe for these scary skull cupcakes which are always are hit at any Halloween party I bring them to. I was inspired by the movie 'Night of the Living Dead' when creating them.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (18.25oz) package devil's food cake mix (such as Duncan Hines®)</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 ½ (16oz) packages prepared vanilla frosting</li>
            <li>1 (7 ounce) pouch prepared chocolate frosting</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Line two 12-cup muffin tins with paper liners, preferable dark-colored or Halloween-themed ones.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Combine cake mix, water, eggs, and oil in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on low speed until moistened, about 30 seconds. Beat at medium speed until batter is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 18 to 21 minutes. Remove from oven and cool tins on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Remove cupcakes from the tins and cool completely on a wire rack before decorating, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4</strong>: Frost each cupcake with a thin layer of white vanilla frosting and refrigerate for 30 minutes to make decorating easier.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 5</strong>: Remove cupcakes from fridge and apply a second layer of white frosting. Fill a piping bag outfitted with a small round tip with chocolate frosting and draw a skull face on the cupcakes: pipe large ovals for the eyes, two dots for the nostrils, and a large "stitched" smile for the mouth.</li>
        </ol>
