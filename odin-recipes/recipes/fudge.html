        <p>This fantasy fudge recipe is straight from the label of a well-known brand of marshmallow cream. After some time, the company changed the recipe, but this is the original for smooth chocolate and marshmallow cream fudge with walnuts. This recipe makes a large batch (3 pounds!) so consider gifting some of these sweet fudgy morsels to friends and family during the holidays.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups white sugar</li>

            <li>1 (12oz) bag semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1 (7oz) jar marshmallow cream</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
